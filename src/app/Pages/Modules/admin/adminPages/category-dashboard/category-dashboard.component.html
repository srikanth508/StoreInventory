                            appliances to convert mains voltage to low voltage to power electronic devices. They are
                            available in power ratings ranging from mW to MW. The insulated laminations minimizes eddy
                            current losses in the iron core</td>

                            high current circuits, safely isolating measurement and control circuitry from the high
                            voltages or currents. The primary winding of the transformer is connected to the high
                            voltage or high current circuit, and the meter or relay is connected to the secondary
                            circuit.</td>

                        <td>These are used for high frequency work. The lack of a core means very low inductance. All
                            current excites current and induces secondary voltage which is proportional to the mutual
                            inductance.[19] Such transformers may be nothing more than a few turns of wire soldered onto
                            a printed circuit board</td>
